  <h1>The geometry of linear equations</h1>
  <p>
    The fundamental problem of linear algebra is to solve \(n\) linear equations in \(n\) unknowns.<br>
    For example:
    \[
      \mysys{2x-y&=0\\-x+2y&=3}
    \]
    In this first lecture on linear algebra we view this problem in three ways.<br>
    The system above is two dimensional (\(n=2\)). 
    By adding a third variable \(z\) we could expand it to three dimensions.
  </p>

  <h2>Row Picture</h2>
  <p>
    Plot the points that satisfy each equation. 
    The intersection of the plots (if they do intersect) represents 
    the solution to the system of equations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at Figure 1 we see that the solution to this system of equations is 
    \(x=1, y=2\).
  </p>

        <b>Figure 1.</b> 
          The lines 
          <span style="color:blue">\(2x-y=0\)</span> and 
          <span style="color:red">\(-x+2y=3\)</span> 
          intersect at the point (1,2).
        </p>
      </figcaption>
    </blockquote>
  </figure>

  <p>
    We plug this solution in to the original system of equations to check our work:
    \[\mysys{2\cdot 2-2&=0\\-1+2\cdot 2&=3}\]
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution to a three dimensional system of equations is the common point 
    of the intersection of three planes (if there is one).
  </p>

  <h2>Column picture</h2>
  <p>
    In the column picture we rewrite the system of linear equations as a single equation 
    by turning the coefficients in the columns of the system into vectors:
    \[
      x\mymat{2\\-1} + y\mymat{-1\\2} = \mymat{0\\3}
    \]
    Given two vectors \(\overrightarrow{c}\) and \(\overrightarrow{d}\) and scalars \(x\) and \(y\), 
    the sum \(xc + yd\) is called a <span class=nowrapi>linear combination</span> 
    of c and d. Linear combinations are important throughout this course.
  </p>
  <p>
    Geometrically, we want to find numbers x and y so that x copies of 
    vector \(\mymat{2\\-1}\) added to y copies of vector \(\mymat{-1\\2}\) equals 
    the vector \(\mymat{0\\3}\). As we can see from Figure 2, \(x=1\) and \(y=2\), 
    which agrees with the row picture in Figure 1.
  </p>

      <figcaption>
        <p>
          <b>Figure 2.</b> A linear combination of the column vectors 
          equals the vector \(\overrightarrow{b}\).

  <h2>Matrix Picture (aka, Matrix Form)</h2>
  <p>
    We write the system of equations:
    \[\mysys{2x-y&=0\\-x+2y&=3}\]
    as a single equation by using matrices and vectors:
    \[
      \mymat{2&-1\\-1&2}\mymat{x\\y}=\mymat{0\\3}
    \]
    \[
      Ax = b
    \]
    The matrix \(A = \mymat{2&-1\\-1&2}\) is called the 
    <span class="nowrapi">coefficient matrix</span>.<br>
    The vector \(\overrightarrow{x}=\mymat{x\\y}\) is the vector of unknowns.<br>
    The values on the right hand side of the equations form 
    the vector \(\overrightarrow{b}=\mymat{0\\3}\).
  </p>
  <p>
    The three dimensional matrix picture is very like the two dimensional one, 
    except that the vectors and matrices increase in size.
  </p>

  <h2>Matrix Multiplication</h2>
  <p>
    How do we multiply a matrix \(A\) by a vector \(\overrightarrow{x}\)?
    \[\mymat{2&5\\1&3}\mymat{1\\2}=?\]
  </p>
  <p>
    One method is to think of the entries of \(\overrightarrow{x}\) as the coefficients 
    of a linear combination of the column vectors of the matrix:
    \[
      \mysys{
        \mymat{2&5\\1&3}\mymat{x_1\\x_2} &= x_1\mymat{2\\1}+x_2\mymat{5\\3}\\
        &=1\mymat{2\\1}+2\mymat{5\\3}\\
        &=\mymat{12\\7}
      }
    \]
    This technique shows that \(Ax\) is a linear combination of the columns of \(A\).
  </p>
  <p>
    You may also calculate the product \(Ax\) by taking the dot product of 
    each row of \(A\) with the vector \(\overrightarrow{x}\):
    \[
      \mysys{
        \mymat{2&5\\1&3}\mymat{x_1\\x_2}&=\mymat{2\cdot x_1+5\cdot x_2\\1\cdot x_1+3\cdot x_2}\\
        &=\mymat{2\cdot 1+5\cdot 2\\1\cdot 1+3\cdot 2}\\
        &=\mymat{12\\7}
      }
    \]
  </p>

  <h2>Linear Independence</h2>
  <p>
    In the column and matrix pictures, 
    the right hand side of the equation is a vector \(b\).
  </p>
  <p>
    Given a matrix \(A\), can we solve \(Ax=b\) for every possible vector \(b\)?<br>
    In other words, do the linear combinations of the column vectors fill the xy-plane 
    (or space, in the three dimensional case)?<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    If the answer is "no", we say that \(A\) is a 
    <span class="nowrapi">singular matrix</span>.
    In this singular case, its column vectors are 
    <span class="nowrapi">linearly dependent</span>; all linear combinations of those vectors 
    lie on a point or line (in two dimensions) or on a point, line or plane 
    (in three dimensions).
    The combinations do not fill the whole space.
